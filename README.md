# AWS Training
This repository contains all the documents, exercises and solutions needed for my AWS training and my AWS and Terraform training.

## How to use
The main branch only contains the slides for the training. These can be found under `docs`. Here you can find the slides for the AWS as well as for the AWS & Terraform training.
The exercises and the respective solutions can be found in their own branches. The branches of the exercises are prefixed with `task` and the solutions with `solution`.
